as of 2.0-beta-6 or later, GuiceyFruit supports the use of Spring injection annotations. If you have some existing code which is using a combination of JSR250 and Spring annontations you can let GuiceyFruit inject your beans using the Guice module mechanism.

For example a bean with the following combination of @Autowired and @Resource would be injected by GuiceyFruit...

{{{
public class MyBean {
  @Autowired
  SomeDto someDto;

  @Resource
  DataSource customerDataSource;
}}}

You just need to ensure you add the SpringModule into your Guice injector. For example

{{{
Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(new SpringModule(), new Jsr250Module(), new MyModule());
}}}

This also supports the [Lifecycle] support from JSR 250 as well as invoking the Spring InitializingBean or DisposableBean interfaces

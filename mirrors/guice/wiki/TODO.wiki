#summary Stuff to do before our initial release.

  * Upfront error checking (i.e. "Foo is missing a dependency.")
  * Write a users guide
  * Support startup tasks, pick one: 
    * Eagerly load some singletons
    * Inject a "main" class (perhaps per module)
    * Rely on static injection? If so, we're done!
  * Make it stupid simple to use Guice in a web application, scopes, intitialization, maybe a web application template, etc.
  * Really simple interception using AOP Alliance

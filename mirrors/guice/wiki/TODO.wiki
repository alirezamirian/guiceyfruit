#summary Stuff to do before our initial release.

  * users' guide
  * better error handling when multiple params missing bindings

Done:
  * inject factories, still need to support toFactory(Key)
  * better error messages for "required=false" (limited scope of @Inject)
  * better error message for to(T) with a scope
  * better error message for duplicate scopes
  * sort error messages
  * implicit bindings
  * look up constructors for DefaultFactory when creating container
  * better error sources. include source in exception messages (does this make sense?)
  * overload link()--make sure overloadings are adequate
